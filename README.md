## üöÄ Installation

GengoWatcher is a Python application requiring Python 3.8 or newer.

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tdawe1/GengoWatcher.git
cd GengoWatcher
```

**2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended)**

Using a virtual environment keeps project dependencies isolated from your system's global Python installation.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Usage

**1. First Run**

Launch the application from your terminal:

```bash
python -m gengowatcher.main
```

The first time you run this, it will create a default `config.ini` file and then exit with a message.

**2. Configure the Application**

Before running again, you **must** open `config.ini` in a text editor and configure it.

- **`feed_url`**: This is the most important setting. Replace the default placeholder with your personal Gengo RSS feed URL.
- **`sound_file`**: On macOS/Linux, you should change the default path to a valid path for a sound file on your system.

**3. Launch**

Once configured, run the application again to start monitoring:

```bash
python -m gengowatcher.main
```

### üìù Example `config.ini`

Below is an example of what your `config.ini` might look like after initial setup:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
feed_url = https://example.com/your-gengo-feed-url.xml
min_reward = 0.00
sound_alert = true
desktop_notification = true
sound_file = alert.wav
csv_logging = true
csv_log_path = logs/all_entries.csv

[ADVANCED]
check_interval = 30
backoff_max = 300
```

- Replace `feed_url` with your personal Gengo RSS feed URL.
- Adjust `min_reward`, `sound_file`, and other options as needed.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

#### Terminal Flickering or Rendering Issues

This application uses a Text-Based User Interface (TUI) which draws and redraws itself rapidly. Older terminals (like the default `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` on Windows) may struggle to keep up, causing flickering or graphical glitches.

**Solution**: Use a modern, hardware-accelerated terminal for the best experience.
-   **Windows**: [**Windows Terminal**](https://aka.ms/terminal) (recommended, available on the Microsoft Store)
-   **macOS**: [**iTerm2**](https://iterm2.com/)
-   **Linux/Cross-Platform**: [**Alacritty**](https://alacritty.org/), [**Kitty**](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
