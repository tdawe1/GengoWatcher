# GengoWatcher

A terminal-based utility for monitoring RSS feeds. It provides desktop notifications and filters new entries based on user-defined criteria. The application is primarily designed for use with Gengo's RSS feed but can be configured for other feeds.

## üíæ Standalone Executable

For users who do not wish to install Python or manage dependencies, a pre-compiled executable is available.

1.  Navigate to the **[Releases](https://github.com/tdawe1/GengoWatcher/releases)** page.
2.  Download the `GengoWatcher-vX.X.X.exe` file from the most recent release.
3.  Place the executable in its own folder.
4.  Run the executable. A `config.ini` file will be generated in the same directory for configuration.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Terminal User Interface:** Provides a text-based user interface using the `rich` library for formatted output, including a status dashboard and tables.
*   **Reward-Based Filtering:** Allows users to set a minimum monetary value to filter which feed entries trigger an alert.
*   **Desktop Notifications:** Delivers desktop notifications via `plyer` and can play a `.wav` sound file upon finding a qualifying entry.
*   **Interactive Console:** An interactive console accepts commands and aliases for real-time application control.
*   **State Persistence:** The application saves the last-seen feed entry to `config.ini` on exit, allowing it to resume without reprocessing old entries.
*   **Configuration File:** Most application behavior is controlled through a `config.ini` file.
*   **Error Handling:** Implements an exponential backoff strategy to handle temporary network or feed availability issues.
*   **Logging:** Can maintain a main application log and a secondary log that records all entries found in the feed.

*   **`[Logging]`**
    *   `log_main_enabled`: Toggles the main application log (`rss_check_log.txt`).
