# GengoWatcher v1.2.1

GengoWatcher is a sophisticated terminal application designed to monitor RSS feeds, specifically for platforms like Gengo, to find and alert you to new freelance jobs the instant they become available. It features a rich, interactive text-based user interface (TUI) that runs directly in your terminal, providing real-time status updates and command controls.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Instant Notifications**: Opens new jobs in your browser immediately upon discovery, giving you the best chance to secure the work.
- **Rich Interactive TUI**: A clean, modern interface built with Rich that provides at-a-glance status, recent activity, and a list of available commands.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Customizable Alerts**:
    - Filter jobs by a minimum reward value.
    - Toggle desktop notifications on/off.
    - Toggle sound alerts on/off (with support for custom sound files).
- **Interactive Controls**: Pause, resume, restart, and trigger manual checks on the fly without ever leaving the terminal.
- **Configuration on the Fly**: Adjust settings like minimum reward and notification toggles instantly with commands.
- **Robust & Efficient**: Low CPU usage while idle, handles connection errors with an exponential backoff strategy, and automatically re-establishes connections.
- **Persistent State**: Remembers the last job seen, so you only get notified about truly new entries, even after restarting.
- **CSV Logging**: Optionally logs every job entry it finds to a CSV file for historical data analysis.

## üöÄ Installation

GengoWatcher is a Python application. To run it, you'll need Python 3.8 or newer.

**1. Clone the Repository**

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GengoWatcher.git
cd GengoWatcher
```

**2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies without affecting your system's global Python installation.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install Dependencies**

Install all the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Usage

**First Run**

The first time you run the application, it will automatically create a `config.ini` file and then exit.

```bash
python main.py
```
> Created default 'config.ini'. Please review it and restart the application.

Before running again, you **must** open `config.ini` in a text editor and configure it, paying special attention to the following:

- **`feed_url`**: This is the most important setting. Replace the default Guardian RSS feed with your personal Gengo RSS feed URL.
- **`sound_file`**: By default, this points to a standard Windows sound. On macOS/Linux, you should change this to a valid path for a `.wav` file (e.g., `/System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff`).

**Running the Application**

Once configured, launch the application again from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The GengoWatcher interface will load, and it will begin monitoring your feed.
